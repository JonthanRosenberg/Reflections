What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Well, the obvious pro is total control and the obvious con is forgetfulness




Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because some version control systems belive in the importance of individual file change, and others, like Git, don't.




How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Just use it from one commit to the previous one....




How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

The reason is that I can freely and safely can go back to a previous version and continue from there like nothing happend



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

for app developing course
